25: Title of research study: DUET: Dual United Event-Based Timelines (IRB # 24-559)Principal Investigator:Name: Sang Won LeePhone: 540-231-4857Email: sangwonlee@vt.edu Other study contact(s):Name: Andy LuuPhone: 571-332-0057Email: andyluu@vt.edu Key Information: The following is a short summary of this study to help you decide whether or not to be a part of this study. More detailed information is listed later on in this form. The purpose of this study is to get a better understanding of how security camera operators currently search for specific events over long periods of time and how the new system that we designed can assist them in the search process. This study is a one-hour-long session where we will simply ask you about your experiences and opinions with viewing long videos or surveillance video footage and then have you answer some questions by completing tasks with the interface that we developed. The following sections contain more detailed information.Detailed Information: The following is more detailed information about this study in addition to the information listed above.Who can I talk to?If you have questions  concerns  or complaints  or think the research has hurt you  talk to the research team at andyluu@vt.eduThis research has been reviewed and approved by the Virginia Tech Institutional Review Board (IRB). You may communicate with them at 540-231-3732 or irb@vt.edu if:You have questions about your rights as a research subjectYour questions  concerns  or complaints are not being answered by the research teamYou cannot reach the research teamYou want to talk to someone besides the research team to provide feedback about this researchHow many people will be studied?We plan to include about 15-30 people in this research study.What happens if I say yes  I want to be in this research? The researchers will provide a survey that should take about one hour to complete.During the survey  we will ask you about your experiences and opinions with viewing long videos or surveillance video footage.Afterward  you will be asked to answer questions by completing a set of tasks using a system that we created that has publicly available security camera footage with events throughout that footage and five different timeline visualizations to navigate through those events in the video.What happens if I say yes  but I change my mind later?You can leave the research at any time  for any reason  and it will not be held against you. If you decide to leave the research  contact the investigator so that the investigator can delete any of the information about you that we collected.Is there any way being in this study could be bad for me? (Detailed Risks)There are no known risks to participating in this study.What happens to the information collected for the research?We will make every effort to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information  including research study and medical records  only to people who have a need to review this information. We cannot promise complete confidentiality. Organizations that may inspect and copy your information include the IRB  Human Research Protection Program  and other authorized representatives of Virginia Tech.The results of this research study may be presented in summary form at conferences  in presentations  reports to the sponsor  academic papers  and as part of a thesis/dissertation.Can I be removed from the research without my OK?The person in charge of the research study or the sponsor can remove you from the research study without your approval. Possible reasons for removal include: if we have reason to believe you do not meet the eligibility requirements (i.e.  are not a security camera operator or related occupation that views long hours of video footage with event-based data)What else do I need to know? If you agree to take part in this research study  the research team will enter the email addresses into a random drawing and compensation will be given to approximately ten percent of participants as a $10 gift card. The odds of being selected will be maintained as 1 in 10. The participants will be contacted separately.

37: In this study  you will be asked to use a video player with five different timeline visualizations to complete tasks in a random order. The following tutorial describes the five timeline visualizations (Timeline 1  2  3  4  and 5). Please watch the video carefully and try to understand how each timeline visualization works before you move on to the following questions.
38: Please watch this quick tutorial about how to use the five different timeline visualizations and confirm that you have watched the entire tutorial. Here is a link to each of the timeline visualizations if you want to explore any of them further:Timeline 1 (Base Interface)Timeline 2 (Density Graph)Timeline 3 (Event Blocks)Timeline 4 (Density Graph + Event Blocks)Timeline 5 (Event Thumbnails)If you have any troubles viewing the videos here is a link to the YouTube Channel: https://youtube.com/@andyluu8958
